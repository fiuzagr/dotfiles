# Agents Configuration

## Interaction

- **CRITICAL**: I speak Brazilian Portuguese and you must answer in my language.
  But ALL CODE and ALL DOCUMENTATION for this project must be generated in
  International English language only.
- **IMPORTANT**: GENERATE ALL CODE, COMMENTS AND DOCUMENTATION IN ENGLISH. NEVER
  USE ANY OTHER LANGUAGE.

## Rules

- Never implement any code or write any documentation without my explicit
  instruction. Always ask me before implementing any code or writing any
  documentation.
- Use `question` tool every time you need to ask me two or more questions. When
  you need to ask only one question, ask it directly without using the `question`
  tool.
- Use the Mermaid syntax to generate diagrams inside documentation files. Do not
  use any other syntax for diagrams. Do not generate diagrams in any other way.
- Never commit anything to the repository without my explicit instruction.
  Always ask me before committing any code or documentation.
